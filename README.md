# My First C++ Projects

Welcome to my first two projects with C++! While they may be basic, they represent my initial foray into programming with this powerful language.

## Project 1: Supermarket Billing System and Admin Portal
A simple C++ application designed for small shop owners to manage their accounts, shop items, and create bills. This project includes:
- **Functionality**: Users can add, delete, and update shop items, as well as generate bills for customers.
- **Platform Compatibility**: The application can be run on the Terminal of both Windows and Mac OS.
- **Data Management**: Instead of using a database, the C++ fstream library is utilized to store items in files, making it accessible and easy to manage.

## Project 2: Simple Tic Tac Toe
A classic game of Tic Tac Toe implemented in C++, where users can play against the computer. This project features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can enjoy a game of Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The game interface is designed for easy interaction and enjoyable gameplay.
- **Logic Implementation**: The game logic is implemented using C++ programming principles, providing a fun and challenging experience.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding!
